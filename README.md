# ResNet50_Fruit_Freshness

Optimized a ResNET50 neural network with a multivariate fruit dataset to accurately identify each fruit and assess freshness levels.
Selected for the Hong Kong Science Park (HKSTP) DeepTech Talent Training Program, I completed an intensive two-week course covering advanced AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning techniques, with a focus on Computer Vision. For the program's final project competition, my team utilized Transfer Learning in Convolutional Neural Networks to develop a high-accuracy model, effectively distinguishing between different fruits and evaluating their freshness. Potentially deployable in agricultural and commercial settings, this model has the capability of enhancing quality control, optimizing supply chain management, and improving inventory systems, this model demonstrates the potential of cutting-edge AI in revolutionizing traditional industries.
